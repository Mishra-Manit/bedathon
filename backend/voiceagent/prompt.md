I'm building a housing platform for Virginia Tech students in Blacksburg as part of VT Hacks. The platform has two main components: my teammate is developing a roommate matching system that uses questionnaires to match students with compatible roommates, apartments, and dorms based on their preferences. My focus is building an AI agent that automates the housing search process by making phone calls to leasing offices to get real-time availability and rates, negotiate prices on behalf of students, and extract structured information from these conversations. The agent uses Twilio for telephony infrastructure and OpenAI's Realtime API for natural voice conversations, allowing it to have dynamic discussions with leasing office staff, ask about student specials, schedule tours, and gather information about amenities and application requirements. Additionally, we're considering features like creating personalized day-in-the-life schedules that show on a Mapbox interface how different housing locations would impact a student's daily routine based on their class schedule and activities.
